I am a master candidate at Department of  Electronic and Communication of Xiamen University and expected to graduated in June 2016. I'm a optimistic and dedicated guy. Devote to Computer, Philosophy and Psychology. My interest hobbies are widespread, like basketball,instrument swimming, travel etc.

My dreams are:

1. to reach where I want to go and eat whatever I love.
2. to work at my favourite job and have  miscellaneous leisure activities.

I'm a big fan of vim and use it for almost all of my writing, I couldn’t live without in my day-to-day editing.I like unix/linux very much, and also have rich experience with common unix command line utilities. I constantly seeking out some new stuff to learn, and have found many useful tools to help me work efficiently, such as apvlv, mutt, awesome, tmux and vichrome.

这是熊苗的主页。每一个优秀的人，都会有一段沉默的时光。那一段时光，是付出了很多努力，忍受孤独和寂寞，不抱怨不诉苦，日后说起时，连自己都能被感动的日子。如果将来我是一个还算优秀的人，那么我的研究生阶段就是这段所谓的时光。我不知道老天为何要让我在生活、学习和感情上都经历这么多挫折，但是我从不低头，更勇敢更乐观的活。可是，我不过是个普通人而已。我的座右铭是，"Victory belongs to the most persevering!" 。
