I am a master candidate at Department of Computer Science and Technology of Xiamen University and expected to graduated in June 2014. I'm a passionate guy. Passionate about Computer Science and Philosophy. My interest hobbies are widespread, like mountain climbing, swimming, go to the cinema, travel etc.

My dreams are:

1. to overcome cognitive biases and practice the art of human rationality.
1. to reach mastery in computer programming and to make the world more beautiful.

I'm a big fan of vim and use it for almost all of my writing, I couldn’t live without in my day-to-day editing.I like unix/linux very much, and also have rich experience with common unix command line utilities. I constantly seeking out some new stuff to learn, and have found many useful tools to help me work efficiently, such as apvlv, mutt, awesome, tmux and vichrome.

这是赖明星的主页。每一个优秀的人，都会有一段沉默的时光。那一段时光，是付出了很多努力，忍受孤独和寂寞，不抱怨不诉苦，日后说起时，连自己都能被感动的日子。如果将来我是一个还算优秀的人，那么我的研究生阶段就是这段所谓的时光。我不知道老天为何要让我在生活、学习和感情上都经历这么多挫折，又让我遇到这么多愿意帮助我的老师和朋友，让我不低头，更勇敢的活。可是，我不过是个普通人啊。我的座右铭是，"Nothing replaces hard work!" ，我也很喜欢下面这两句话：

>芝兰生于深谷，不以无人而不芳  
>君子修身养德，不以穷困而改志
